# minikordo

A tiny 8-beat looper with three record tracks and one freestyle track.

While the looper is playing, pressing notes while selecting a record track will overwrite those notes into the track live (you can also choose to completely wipe the track). Select the freestyle track to prevent overwriting any of the record tracks while playing live.
